thinking about how students are going to search:

select city

if 'prefer not to say is selcted' reply #of course that is fine but it is more difficult for us to refine your search#

select group size
=================

Question - number selection

Query - if '1' is selected ask 'is this just for you or do you want to see availability for couples?' provide drop down 'just for me' OR 'for both of us'

Query if '2' is selected ask 'do you want 2 bedrooms or are you looking for 1 bedroom room for a couple?' provide drop down '2 room's OR 1 'for both of us'

search results:
