REFERENCE: Student Palace – House Images DB Schema & Rules
=========================================================

Table: house_images
-------------------
Columns (from PRAGMA table_info):
- id (INTEGER, PK, AUTOINCREMENT)
- house_id (INTEGER, NOT NULL)  
  → Foreign key reference to houses.id

- file_name (TEXT, NOT NULL)  
  → Legacy column, MUST be set (duplicate of filename)

- filename (TEXT, NOT NULL)  
  → Newer column, MUST also be set (duplicate of file_name)

- file_path (TEXT, NOT NULL)  
  → Relative path under /static, e.g. "uploads/houses/abc.jpg"  
  → DO NOT prefix with "/" (Flask’s url_for('static', …) will break)

- width (INTEGER, NOT NULL)  
  → Image pixel width, e.g. 1920

- height (INTEGER, NOT NULL)  
  → Image pixel height, e.g. 1080

- bytes (INTEGER, NOT NULL)  
  → File size in bytes, e.g. 245367

- is_primary (INTEGER, NOT NULL, DEFAULT 0)  
  → Exactly one image per house should have is_primary=1  
  → Used for thumbnails / cover photo  
  → If none exists, fall back to first by sort_order

- sort_order (INTEGER, NOT NULL, DEFAULT 0)  
  → Controls gallery order  
  → Default 0, increment when inserting multiple images

- created_at (TEXT, NOT NULL)  
  → ISO 8601 string, e.g. "2025-08-28T16:14:33"

Schema Meta
-----------
- Currently NO schema_meta table in DB  
- Recommended if schema changes later:  
  key = 'house_images_version', val = 'v1'

Insert Rules
------------
When saving an uploaded image, populate ALL required fields:

file_name      = "<uuid>.jpg"  
filename       = "<uuid>.jpg"  
file_path      = "uploads/houses/<uuid>.jpg"  
width          = measured width  
height         = measured height  
bytes          = file size in bytes  
is_primary     = 1 if first image for house, else 0  
sort_order     = (next available number for this house)  
created_at     = ISO timestamp at insert

⚠️ If you omit ANY of these → SQLite will raise “NOT NULL constraint failed”.  
⚠️ Especially critical: file_name, filename, file_path, width, height, bytes.

Reading Rules
-------------
- Always use:
    COALESCE(filename, file_name) AS fname
  → Protects against environments where only one is populated.

- Full path in HTML:
    url_for("static", filename=file_path)

- Ensure file_path does NOT start with "/"  
  (Otherwise `url_for` doubles the slash → broken URLs)

Known Pitfalls
--------------
❌ Environments diverged: some had file_name only, others had filename only  
❌ file_path added later caused insert errors when code didn’t supply it  
❌ width/height/bytes are required → cannot be NULL  
❌ Confusion between filename vs file_name broke SELECT queries  
❌ Storing file_path with leading "/" broke Flask static serving

Best Practices
--------------
✅ Always fill BOTH file_name and filename with same value  
✅ Ensure exactly ONE image per house has is_primary=1  
✅ Use sort_order gaps (+10) for flexibility in reordering  
✅ Store relative paths (uploads/houses/abc.jpg)  
✅ Verify dimensions + bytes at upload before DB insert  
✅ Wrap DB insert in try/except + rollback on failure  
✅ Document any schema change in this file and bump version

Future Ideas
------------
- Add schema_meta for version tracking  
- Add is_deleted (soft delete) instead of removing rows  
- Add caption/alt_text for accessibility and SEO  
- Add landlord_id reference for faster ownership checks  
- Add file_hash (e.g., SHA256) to prevent duplicate uploads

SQL Snippets
------------
Create Table (current state):
CREATE TABLE house_images (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    house_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    file_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    width INTEGER NOT NULL,
    height INTEGER NOT NULL,
    bytes INTEGER NOT NULL,
    is_primary INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    sort_order INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

Insert Example (Python DB-API style):
conn.execute("""
INSERT INTO house_images
(house_id, file_name, filename, file_path, width, height, bytes,
 is_primary, sort_order, created_at)
VALUES (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)
""", (
    hid, "abc123.jpg", "abc123.jpg", "uploads/houses/abc123.jpg",
    1920, 1080, 245367, 1, 0, dt.utcnow().isoformat()
))

Select Example (safe for legacy fields):
SELECT id,
       COALESCE(filename, file_name) AS fname,
       file_path, width, height, bytes,
       is_primary, sort_order, created_at
FROM house_images
WHERE house_id=?
ORDER BY is_primary DESC, sort_order ASC, id ASC;

Debugging
---------
- Check schema live: /debug/hi-schema
- Validate NOT NULL rules before deploying inserts
- Compare schema across dev/prod to avoid mismatches
