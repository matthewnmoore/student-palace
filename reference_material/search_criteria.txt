SEARCH FIELDS (Landing Page)
	1.	City (required)

	•	Dropdown of active cities.
	•	Only show results for the chosen city.

	2.	Group size (required)

	•	Show only houses that can accommodate the group right now (within the chosen academic year window).
	•	House share listings: a house qualifies if it has at least that many rooms effectively available during the year window.
	•	Whole house listings: a house qualifies if its total bedrooms and available bedrooms are exactly equal to the group size, and the house is effectively available during the year window.

	3.	Academic year (required)

	•	Academic year runs 1 July → 30 June (e.g., 2025/2026 = 1 Jul 2025 – 30 Jun 2026).
	•	A room’s effective start date is:
• if is_let = 1 and let_until is set → day after let_until.
• otherwise → available_from (or “today” if empty).
	•	A house/room qualifies for an academic year if its effective start date falls inside that year’s window.

	4.	Gender preference (required)

	•	Landlord sets house as: “Male Only” / “Female Only” / “Anyone / Mixed”.
	•	Student answers in two steps:
A. “I want a house that is…” → options:
• “Just Male”
• “Just Female”
• “Anything, I am not fussy”
B. If “Anything…” chosen → follow-up:
• “Male”
• “Female”
• “I’d rather not say”
	•	Result logic:
• Just Male → show “Male Only”.
• Just Female → show “Female Only”.
• Anything + Male → show “Anyone/Mixed” + “Male Only”.
• Anything + Female → show “Anyone/Mixed” + “Female Only”.
• Anything + Prefer not to say → show “Anyone/Mixed” + “Male Only” + “Female Only”.

	5.	Ensuite (optional)

	•	Checkbox: “Must have ensuite”.
	•	If checked: only show rooms with ensuite (or, for whole houses, only those where every room for that group has ensuite).

	6.	Bills included (optional)

	•	Checkbox: “Bills included”.
	•	If checked: only houses with bills_option = "yes".

Do you want me to also rewrite the group size rule in a few plain examples (like we did for the academic year) so you’ve got a reference list of “what passes / what doesn’t”?
