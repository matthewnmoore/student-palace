Yes 👍 — you don’t have to pay for good CAPTCHA protection:
	•	Google reCAPTCHA
	•	Free. Widely used.
	•	Downsides: heavy tracking, users sometimes see annoying picture puzzles.
	•	Cloudflare Turnstile
	•	Free.
	•	Privacy-friendly (doesn’t track users like Google does).
	•	Very lightweight, invisible most of the time.
	•	My personal recommendation for your site.
	•	hCaptcha
	•	Free tier (you only pay at massive scale).
	•	Privacy-better than Google, but sometimes users complain puzzles are harder.

So practically:
	•	Turnstile = easiest, free forever, good UX.
	•	reCAPTCHA = free, but more friction and tracking.
	•	hCaptcha = free, but can feel harder to solve.

For your project: Turnstile is the sweet spot → secure, invisible for most users, and won’t cost you anything.

👉 Do you want me to also explain where in your current flow we’d bolt CAPTCHA on, so you don’t pay in developer hours later?
