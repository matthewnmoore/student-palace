Here’s a plain-English reference for how each of the 9 integrated search filters should work in Student Palace:

⸻

1. City
	•	Students must pick a city from the dropdown.
	•	Only properties in that city (where houses.city matches) are shown.
	•	The city list is controlled by the admin, so landlords cannot add their own.

⸻

2. Academic year
	•	Academic year runs from 1 July to 30 June.
	•	Each room has either:
• An “Available from” date (if not currently let), or
• The day after its “Let until” date (if currently let).
	•	That effective availability date is mapped into the right academic year window.
	•	Only properties/rooms whose availability falls inside the chosen year are shown.

⸻

3. Gender preference
	•	From houses.gender_preference.
	•	If “Male” → only show if search = Male or Either.
	•	If “Female” → only show if search = Female or Either.
	•	If “Mixed” → always show (open to all).
	•	If “Either” → always show.

⸻

4. Ensuite
	•	Room-level filter (rooms.ensuite).
	•	If student ticks “Ensuite”, only rooms with ensuite = yes are included.
	•	If not ticked, both ensuite and non-ensuite rooms are shown.

⸻

5. Group size
	•	Depends on letting type:
• Whole property: matches only if bedrooms_total == group size AND all rooms are available.
• Room-only (shared): matches if number of available rooms ≥ group size.
	•	Ensures students can book either as a group or as individuals.

⸻

6. Price
	•	Stored as monthly rent (price_pcm).
	•	Student sets a maximum budget.
	•	Convert PCM to per week for comparison using: (pcm * 12) / 52.
	•	Filter out rooms/properties where rent per person is higher than the chosen maximum.

⸻

7. Bills included
	•	From houses.bills_option.
	•	Options: “Yes” (all bills included), “Some” (certain utilities), “No” (none).
	•	If student selects one option, only matching properties are shown.
	•	If no option selected, all are included.

⸻

8. Suitable for couples
	•	Room-level filter (rooms.couples_ok).
	•	If student selects this, only rooms marked as suitable for couples are shown.
	•	Otherwise, both types are shown.

⸻

9. Accessible for disabled people
	•	Room-level filter (rooms.disabled_ok).
	•	If student selects this, only rooms marked as accessible are shown.
	•	Otherwise, both types are shown.

⸻

⚡ In short:
	•	City and Academic year are mandatory filters (always required).
	•	The other 7 are optional refinements.
