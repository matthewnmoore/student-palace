    <h1 class="mt-0">About Us – Student Palace</h1>
    <p>We’re Matthew and Heidi, private landlords based in Swansea with a small portfolio of student houses. Over the years we’ve had the same conversations again and again with other landlords: where should we advertise, how many Facebook groups do we need to post in, and how much do the big property portals charge?</p>

    <p>The truth is, those costs and complications usually end up being passed on to the students. Some utility providers have their own platforms but tie you into their packages, and the big purpose-built student complexes have slick advertising of their own. But for smaller, independent landlords like us, there hasn’t really been one place to come together and advertise fairly.</p>

    <p>That’s why, with Heidi’s unwavering patience and support, I decided to set up Student Palace. Our aim is simple: to give landlords an affordable, easy way to list their properties, and to give students a clear, trustworthy place to find them.</p>

    <p>Student Palace is about levelling the playing field – helping independent landlords and students connect directly, without the noise, the hidden costs or the pushy extras. It’s a platform created by landlords, for landlords and students, built around fairness, simplicity and trust.</p>

    <p>I’d love to keep the site free forever, but it’s grown into a bit of a monster! I’m only asking enough to cover the basics like hosting and running costs – this has never been about making money. If you do find the site useful, a small donation towards keeping it going would be hugely appreciated.</p>

    <p>And if you notice something not working quite right, just let me know – I’ll do my best to get it fixed as quickly as I can.</p>
